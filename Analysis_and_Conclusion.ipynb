        "One interesting point to note above would be that the SVC was more confident in the predictions it made correctly and less confident in the predictions it made incorrectly when compared to the linear model. For instance, the SVC's decision function value for the first label predicted incorrectly was 3.56, while the linear model's was 4.46. The SVC's decision function value for the second label predicted incorrectly was 0.28, while the linear model's was 1.94. This indicates that the SVC is likely a better model for this scenario. Also, since the SVC wasn't very confident in most of its incorrect predictions, it is likely that a larger training set(consisting of more class 1 samples, specifically) would result in increased performance by giving the model more samples from which to generate information. The imbalance in this dataset means that the model is at a disadvantage when it comes to predicting class 1 labels.\n",

        "For the vast majority of machine learning models, their outputs should not directly be taken as law, and must be tempered by expert(in any given area) perspectives. It goes without saying that that also applies to this particular model. Therefore, for human interpretation of these results, one would be advised to also look at the decision function values for a given prediction, not just the prediction itself. This will help highlight areas where human interference is needed."
